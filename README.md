🧠 How It Works
1. Upload Files: Upload your PDF or DOCX files.
    
2. Text Extraction: The app automatically extracts all text from the files.
    
3. Text Chunking: Large text content is chunked into smaller pieces using CharacterTextSplitter.
    
4. Embedding: Each chunk is embedded using GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings.
    
5. Vector Indexing: A FAISS vector index is built to enable semantic similarity search.
    
6. Q&A: When you ask a question, the app retrieves the most relevant text chunks and uses Google Gemini Pro to provide an answer based on those chunks.
